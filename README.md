  4. Quizzes.

- To access our websites, please take the following steps:

1. Make a copy of this repository:

    ```php
      git clone https://github.com/sadiqhasanrupani/edugate-major-project.git
    ```

2. Before proceeding, you need to have nodejs installed on your PC; if not, download it from this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/):

    ```powershell
      cd edugate-major-project
    ```

3. Install the dependencies in both the client and server folders at the same time using this command:

    ```powershell
      cd client; npm install; cd ..; cd server; npm run build
    ```

4. Now create a database called "edugate_db" in MySQL. If you don't have MySQL on your device then download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html).

5. Now set up the `.env` file in both the client and server folder respectively.  
      
- In the client create a file called as `.env` and write the following code inside that file,
  ```ini
    REACT_APP_HOSTED_URL= http://localhost:8080

    # Or you can declare your own backend server 
    # choice is yours.
  ```

- Simultaneously, create a file `.env` inside the server directory and then copy and paste this code inside that file,

  ```ini
  PORT = 8080
  
  # Create a dummy email id for sending mails in the web application
  EMAIL = xyz@gmail.com
  PASS = ********

  SERVICE = gmail

  # LocalHost Database
  SQL_DATABASE = edugate_db 
  SQL_HOST = host address # 127.0.0.1 or localhost
  SQL_USER = user_name # root
  SQL_PASSWORD = ***********
  SQL_PORT = 3306  # sql port is by default is "3306" or you change it, then write here.

  # Secret Token
  SECRET_TOKEN = any_secret_token_you_want

  # Backend Site Address
  HOST_SITE = "http://localhost:8080"
  ```

6. Run this command in two terminals to start both the front end and the back end.

- In the first terminal copy and paste this code
  ```powershell
    cd client; npm start;
  ```
- In the second terminal, copy and paste this code
  ```powershell
    cd server; npm start;
  ```

You are now ready to go!
